# A quick guide to the admin panel

### The tables

The tables used on each page are a sortable, searchable and pageable. This means that the tables can be sorted by each attribute. The search on the otherhand will allow you to search for any term/string in the table.


### Question Groups

The question groups tab lets you add new group questions and edit existing ones. At the top of the view you'll find a dropdown form that adds a new group question. The new group requires a key (preferrably an integer but strings work aswell), name , and a question in the three supported languages.

Below this form the list of is the list of all existing groups. Every group attribute can be edited simply by clicking on them.
